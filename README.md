# Hi, my name is Ivor 👋

## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate about a lot of things, not just coding. But coding is the thing that takes up most of my time, except my dog of course.
Experience wise, I'm a junior developer (for now) but have experience with a number of technologies, mainly Python, Django, Javascript and React. 
I have a litte experience with C too. Work experience, I have over 40 years, in public and private sector, nearly 30 as a Police Officer. 

A few years back I qualified as a CISSP in cyber security but technical roles were hard to find with my level of technical skills then, so
I spent my time doing vulnerability assessments, which was interesting until the point of filling out spreadsheets and powerpoints. But I knew I wanted 
something more technical to challenge the grey matter so I gave up cyber security and turned to coding. And I love it!



I love the challenge of problem solving and learning new skills.  and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions.
