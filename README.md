# Hi, my name is Ivor üëã

## About Me üöÄ

I'm a passionate about a lot of things, not just coding. But coding is the thing that takes up most of my time, except my dog of course.
Experience wise, I'm a junior developer (for now) but have experience with a number of technologies, mainly Python, Django, Javascript and React. 
I have a litte experience with C too. Work experience, I have over 40 years, in public and private sector, nearly 30 as a Police Officer. 

A few years back I qualified as a CISSP in cyber security but technical roles were hard to find with my level of technical skills then, so
I spent my time doing vulnerability assessments, which was interesting until the point of filling out spreadsheets and powerpoints. But I knew I wanted something more technical to challenge the grey matter so I gave up cyber security and turned to coding. And I love it!

I love the challenge of problem solving and learning new skills and that feeling you get when you crack a problem. No matter how small or trivial. Every problem cracked is something new. In fact, in coding and in life, the best lessons come from mistakes. So don't be afraid to make them. I'm not and do. But I'm also as determined as anyone to correct mistakes. 

- üå± Currently learning: working with Python/Django/Django Rest Framework and Javascript/React at the moment. Plan on learning Typescript (I know basics) another front end framework, and PHP/Laravel in the near future. With .Net as a longer term goal. Mostly using ![Exercism] (https://img.shields.io/badge/Exercism-009CAB?style=for-the-badge&logo=exercism&logoColor=white)
- üî≠ Working on: a Django based home finance app and a React based German Shepherd Rescue website (yes, I have one and I'd have more if I could!), whilst updating a ToDo app built in a recently completed coding bootcamp. Plus a few smaller challenges.
- üåç Languages: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, React, Python, Django and Django Rest Framework
