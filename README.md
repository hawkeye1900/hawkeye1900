I'm relatively new to coding, and even newer to GitHub, but like many, I have found in coding, a new passion. There's a lot of things I love doing, not just coding, but it is the thing that takes up most of my time, except my dog of course :heart:.  

Experience wise, I'm a junior developer (for now) but have experience with a number of technologies, mainly HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Javascript and React. I have a little experience with C too. Work experience, I have over 40 years, in public and private sector, nearly 30 as a Police Officer. So, I've seen a bit.

A few years back I qualified as a CISSP in cyber security, but technical roles were hard to find with my level of technical skills then, so
I spent my time doing vulnerability assessments, which was interesting until the point of filling out spreadsheets and PowerPoints. But I knew I wanted something more technical to challenge the grey matter, so I gave up cyber security and turned to coding. And I love it!

I love the challenge of problem solving and learning new skills and that feeling you get when you crack a problem. No matter how small or trivial. Every problem cracked is something new. In fact, in coding and in life, the best lessons come from mistakes. So don't be afraid to make them. I'm not and do. But I'm also as determined as anyone to correct mistakes. 

- üå± Currently learning: working with Python/Django/Django Rest Framework and Javascript/React at the moment. Plan on properly learning Typescript (I know basics), another front-end framework maybe Vue, and PHP/Laravel in the near future. With .Net as a longer-term goal. Mostly using Exercism, Udemy, YouTube and FreeCodeCamp
- üî≠ Working on: a Django based home finance app and a React based German Shepherd Rescue website (yes, I have one and I'd have more if I could!), whilst also updating a ToDo app built in a recently completed coding bootcamp. Plus a few smaller challenges. I've also recently enrolled in Harvard's CS50 course (https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) to bolster my Computer Science knowledge. I actually first enrolled several years ago, but life took over. They update this course every year and it is superb.
- üåç Languages: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, React, Python, Django and Django Rest Framework
- What else do I like doing? Reading, about history, particularly Russian (there can be no doubt the impact Russia has had on Europe and further afield since the early 20th Century) and military history. Music, from Django Reinhardt to Metallica, but very little in the way of chart music. Except Kate Bush, the greatest female singer songwriter ever (IMHO). Others include John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, Larry Carlton, Pat Metheny, Al Di Meola, Rainbow, Deep Purple, Dream Theater and of course, Rush. I could go on......Did I mention I have a dog? Another of my pastimes, walking and playing with her. She needs a lot of attention as she's a rescue. Back on the techie side of things, before I started coding seriously, I was playing with networks and CCNA, I have a full CCNA lab in my office and one day (I hope) I'll get round to doing the CCNA course. I completed the Cisco Foundation network course a few years back. But I'd be rusty now. 

- Finally, what else am I up to - looking for work, as a Full Stack Developer preferably, though I'd be happy in front or back-end roles. I know, coding experience is still at the lower end, but I have so much life experience now, I can offer a lot, not least an absolute determination to never get beaten by a problem. I rarely do, I usually get there.

## Featured Projects üíª

The first two websites I built. I built these for free just for the experience and I learnt an awful lot, about planning, understanding requirements, design and so forth. One day I will return to these and improve them and daresay I will be able to make many changes, but for now they show a basic grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
